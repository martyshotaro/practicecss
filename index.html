<h2>Interest in IT:</h2>

<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>

<p>My interest in IT is specifically in networking because of its interconnected business contacts. This will lead to increased understanding, as networking is an excellent opportunity to exchange practice knowledge by learning techniques in the business of my fellow workmates in the future. Lastly, being on networking means more varied access to new and valuable information, the ability to backup data easily, as all data is stored, which is located on the file server.</p> 
<p>My interest in IT started around after the completion of my Certificate III in Individual Support and Ageing. It was a course that came straight to my mind. That was the time when realization hits me personally, as it should’ve been the thing that I could’ve done instead because I realized that IT is a career that’s beneficial for myself in the long run.</p>
<p>Lastly, there were particular people that motivated me to pursue IT, which were my church friends. Majority of them specialized in networking and the interesting aspect of it was creating rooms with passwords and meeting numbers in WebEx during virtual church services since it’s still lockdown here. They are also in charge of communicating with other IT church people if there are any troubles/uncertainties on how to get people in the virtual chat room, how to kick users out if there are uninvited people who got in our virtual church service and etc. This occurs when the virtual church service commences from the very start to the end.</p>
<p>Currently, I have no experiences on IT at the moment.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

<p>I came to RMIT because they offered me a spot for this unit at Open Universities Australia (OUA), as a pathway for my bachelor’s degree.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I expect to learn the skills that I haven’t learned and the skills that I’ve witnessed from some of my friends who are also IT graduates/students from different universities that include operating systems in both MacOS and Windows, the use of tools for collaboration and communication in Skype and WebEx and the use of office suites.</p>

<h2>Profile Results</h2>                                                                               <hr>                                 
<h3>Results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h3>

<p> - Personality type is a Defender: ISFJ-A</p>
<p> - Mind, which determines on how we interact with our environment (49% extraverted, 51% introverted).
<p> - Energy, which is a trait that indicates where we direct our mental energy (44% intuitive, 56% observant).</p>
<p> - Nature, which is a trait that determines on how we make such decisions and cope with our emotions (40% thinking, 60% feeling).</p>
<p> - Tactics, which reflects out approach to work, planning and decision-making (75% judging, 25% prospecting).</p>
<p> - Identity, this trait stimulates all others that indicate on how confident we are in our decisions and abilities (65% assertive, 35% turbulent).</p>								
                                
<h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>

<p>This result means to me, as it is an eye opener personally because it shows the results that I wasn’t expecting. It also shows the percentage of each traits mentioned, which will help me in terms of how I would act, behave, and take part within a workplace. Based on the results, I found out that my personality type is somewhat unique, as this could bring diversity and another arsenal in terms of different personality types in a workplace. I wasn’t also expecting that my personality type consists of excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and strong social relationships. Also, Defenders like myself are truly benefactors, where kindness meets together that engages other workmates to believe the process inside the workplace, with generosity and enthusiasm. However, despite being a generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change. As with so many things, other individuals with the Defender personality type like myself are more than the sum of their parts, and it’s a strategy they apply as strengths that defines who they are.</p>

<h3>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality type, which is a defender has some disadvantages. These include taking things too personally, defenders do have a trouble when it comes to differentiating and separating impersonal and personal situations, which can lead to possible conflicts. Lastly, any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their personal and professional lives. Also, the repression their feelings; defenders are more sensitive and private, which incorporates their feelings at a great deal. They must protect their own feelings and the inability to convey healthy emotional expressions can result in a lot of stress and frustration, even amongst your team members. Also, being reluctance to change can influence/affect behaviour in a tem within a workplace due to their history and traditions of value in their decisions in a highly manner. These challenges can be especially hard to address, as a situation sometimes needs to reach the breaking point before being convinced by circumstance.<p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>

<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by when taking things too personally, don’t jump to conclusions too quickly when you are being confronted, don’t make such assumptions about criticism or judgement all being directed to you. Maybe it’s not all about you, but about the ones judging and confronting you from their own viewpoint. Even though defenders are sensitive and private, they should practice daily mindfulness. It’s one of the best tools to pull yourself away from your reactive thoughts and into the present moment as it leaves your mind clearer and calmer that results in increasing your self-esteem. Also, it enhances your physical/mental health as it can relieve stress, lower your blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, improve your sleep and it treats substance abuse, depression, and other anxiety orders.</p>

<h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>

<p>Personally, the results above indicate the percentage of each traits mentioned is an eye-opener that will determine in terms of how I would act, behave, and take part within a workplace, in which will also help me. Based on the results, I found out that my personality types are the following, activists, pragmatists, reflectors, and theorists in different percentages and matches of course. Those are the four personal learning styles in a workplace, which could bring different ranges of personality types within a workplace.</p>
<p>For activists, they’re more like to immerse themselves fully in terms of experiencing new things. They tend to be more enthusiastic, flexible and open-minded. Also, they tend to be the first ones to act and consider the consequences later. Learning methods suitable for activists include brainstorming, roleplaying, group discussion and problem setting.</p>
<p>For pragmatists, they need the ability to view learning into practice in real life situations that include abstract concepts and games have limitations in terms of usage unless they have brainstormed and put those ideas into action. Lastly, they may act fast on ideas, and always straight to the point. Learning methods that suit pragmatists are practicals, problem setting, discussions and case studies.</p>  
<p>For reflectors, this style of personality tends to be more relaxed, observe and cautious. They also prefer to analyse and gather information in order to help reach their conclusions. Also, they see the bigger picture by utilising information that they collected from previous experiences, also the ones from present. The learning methods associated with reflectors includes, self-analysis questionnaires, paired discussions, demonstrations, coaching and feedback from others.</p> 
<p>Lastly, for theorists, they would rather think problems logically, value objectivity and rationality and they like to assimilate unalike theories into reasonable theories. Also, they are disciplined and they aim to fit things into a rational order. They are also into principles, theories and basic assumptions. The learning methods associated with theorists include classroom response systems, quotes, tutorials, story telling and models.</p>

<h3>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>

<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality types that matched with this online learning style test that has noticeable disadvantages. For activists, they tend to do too much tasks themselves, which carries too much load in terms of the tasks and objectives ahead of them. Also, they tend to take risks that are unnecessary, get bored with consolidation and implementation and they take action with no valid preparation. For pragmatists, they tend to jump into solutions that are practical without thinking regarding about the conceptual underpinning or a better creative approach. For reflectors, they hold back from direct participation. Also, they’re not quick in terms of decision-making, they tend to be too careful, which leads to taking minimal risks and they are not decisive/dominant. Lastly for theorists, they clash creativity with problems. Also, the time spent on planning is too long, and the inability to apply theoretical aspects in real life situations.</p>
  
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  
<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by these tips as follows. Activists should adapt on embracing new situations, being optimistic regarding about new things, enjoying the company of small group discussions and being highly sociable. Pragmatists are expected to put new ideas that they have provided into practice, or in other words, the attitude of liking to implement what one has learned. Reflectors must be methodical and thoughtful, be a good listener; they also shouldn’t jump into conclusions, and the use of such tools that include brainstorming and journals. Lastly, theorists must be objective, think things in a logical manner, they must go through that rational approach, and they must like tools that include readings, case studies and models.<p>
                                
<h3>Results of Results of another online test of choice (Big Five Personality Test)</h3>  
  
<p> - Factor I, extroversion, there are other given names that include Positive Emotionality or Surgency. (63%).</p>
<p> - Factor II, emotional stability, there are other given names that include Negative Emotionality or Neuroticism. In these two cases’ perspective, Neuroticism and Negative Emotionality can be the contrast of Emotional Stability (74%).</p>
<p> - Factor III, agreeableness (91%).</p>
<p> - Factor IV, conscientiousness. (76%).
<p> - Factor V, intellect/imagination. Often, it’s labelled as Openness to Experience. (59%).

<h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>
  
<p>First of all, the results above indicate the percentage of each traits mentioned demonstrates my actions and behaviour in a team within a workplace. The results state that I have a high level of agreeableness (91%), emotional stability (74%), and conscientiousness (76%). Also, I have a medium level of extroversion (63%) and a low level of intellect/imagination (59%). Those are the four personal learning styles in a workplace, which could bring different ranges of personality types within a workplace.</p>
<p>For agreeableness, individuals who scored a high level of agreeableness can tend to perform well in interpersonal interactions such as customer service through their good use of communication and language. Also, they learn how to avoid conflicts and engaging in such nonsense fights, and they tend to be higher in terms of conformity and will adapt to a company culture better.</p>
<p>For emotional stability, individuals who score a high level of emotional stability can tend to be calm and steady. They also react less emotionally and can’t get upset that easily, which leads to not constantly experiencing negative feelings towards others.</p> 
<p>For conscientiousness, individuals who score a high level of conscientiousness can tend to be empathetic and mindful towards other individuals in a workplace. Also, they are conscious of the first impression that they make on others when they are being introduced. They also feel a sense of duty towards others and they are alert in terms of the effect that their words and actions can have on others in everyday situations.</p> 
<p>For extroversion, individuals who scored a medium level of extroversion like myself are mostly labelled as ambiverts in a workplace. They know how to relate to both people who are vocal and reserved in a workplace that results in having valuable relationships with such ease. Also, they can listen and absorb information that’s presented in front of them during business meetings, and they are also comfortable to use the information in order to advice others or state their personal opinion.</p>
<p>Lastly, for individuals that scored a low level of intellect/imagination tend to be more conventional and traditional in terms of the workplace environment/culture. Also, they tend to use their feelings less that would result in possible conflicts in the workplace.</p>
                                
<h3>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3> 
  
<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality type, which is a defender has some disadvantages.</p>
<p>Individuals who are extroverted tend to struggle to monitor their emotions in check. They may come across as aggressive sometimes, but this can result in unfinished projects and being easily controlled by the opinions of others. Also, they may lack emotional and analytical judgements, and they have the tendency to spend time in the company of others, which leads to their personal work being affected.</p>
<p>Individuals who are emotionally stable may tend to lack levels of creativity and innovation potential. Creativity is associated with such traits that are characteristic of low EQ that includes artistic moodiness, hostile impulsivity, and nonconformism.  It’s also challenging to build relations and working with others who have low levels of nonconformity, which can result to challenge the status quo and replace it with something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Individuals who are high in agreeableness can tend to care about what others think that leads them to have the drive to please others. Lastly, this may result in the neglecting of their own needs just to meet other’s needs/preferences. They also have the inability to say no.</p>
<p>Conscientiousness exposes positive relations with such psychological wellbeing and conceptual work advices that individuals can be too conscientious that leads to an obsessive-compulsiveness behaviour and less positive outcomes individually in a workplace.</p>  
<p>Imaginations can lead you to take such risks of spending more time in your imaginary ideas than actually implementing it in real life situations. It can also lead to a social disconnection and it creates a barrier if you allow fantasy to strip our attention since it’s necessary for general understanding. Lastly, being too intellect can sometimes be too impatient that leaves your level on patience being questioned, if it’s as high as your IQ. Also, little achievements in a workplace can be left unnoticed, and you tend to being controlled by your brain more than your heart, which can lead to lack of empathy and feelings.</p>
  
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3> 
  
<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by these tips as follows.</p> 
<p>Individuals who are extroverted should have the ability to form close associations with others in a workplace. They can also work well in terms of group settings, which leads to their ideas and comments being well received in a workplace. Also, they should have confidence and determination and should likely take charge at times.</p> 
<p>Individuals who are emotionally intelligent are expected to use, identify and manage their personal emotions positively. It should help them to have a better communication, reduced anxiety, less conflicts, empathy, and improvement in terms of relationships with others.</p> 
<p>Individuals who have such levels of agreeableness must perform well in terms of interpersonal interactions that include customer service and they do well in teams. They should use their characteristics as an advantage that would result in having a positive organisational culture.</p>
<p>Individuals who have such levels of conscientiousness are expected to be more responsible as it links to such aspects within a workplace that include performance, physical health and general wellbeing. They are also expected to lower the likelihood of absenteeism and procrastination.</p> 
<p>Lastly, individuals who have good imagination/intellectual skills are expected to be more optimistic. Also, having such imaginations will lead you to have an intimate relationship with such complex concepts and intellectual ideas, which are expected from individuals who possess such qualities within a workplace.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
                                            
<img src="images/getty_506903004_200013332000928076_348061.jpg" width="450" height="300">                                                                                    
<h3>Overview - A summary of what the project will be.</h3>
                           
<p>The project that I’ve chosen is called “Mini Fling It In!” This will be made from a site called MIT app inventor. The key features of this game consist of flicking the ball to a particular area, but there are obstacles that include rectangle lines and they’re immobile throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game. Lastly, It’s recommended for Android smartphone users since it’s more accessible to connect your Android device from your project or game through MIT app inventor, and can also be played to your computer via the emulator, located at the top of the design editor section.</p> 
                            
<img src="images/MIT%20SC%20EMULATOR.jpg">                                          
                                        
<h3>Motivation - A description of why the project will be interesting or useful.</h3>  
  
<p>This would be a useful and an interesting game for individuals due to the fun aspect of it even if it were just a simple game; it takes way your stress, especially if you had a long day from work, studies and etc. This app is a perfect way to relax. Lastly, another interesting part of this is the low level of complexity and difficulty of this app/game, which indicates that it can be played by anyone of any ages. Statistics show that 6.8 million people around over 190 countries have used this app inventor to create more than 24 million apps, which indicates as a good sign.</p>

<h3>Description - A detailed description of the features of the product or service.</h3>
  
<p>The description of the features of MIT App Inventor includes the ability to drop/grab components to a design view and the use of visual blocks language in order to program application behavior. It provides a web based editing for the building of apps through iOS and Android (most recommended) in terms of their operating systems. Also, it has applied a block-based programming language built by Google Blockly. It also consists of such inspirations from languages that include StarLogo TNG and Scratch, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. The purpose of its usage is it provides the families and communities the mobile solutions to real life situations/problems. Also, it’s adaptable way to serve requirements in terms of specific populations that include making aps for emergency and first responders and robotics. Other features of this app inventor include a user interface that consists of two main editors that include design editor and blocks editor. Design editor is a drop and drag interface that blueprints the elements of the individual’s user interface (UI), whereas the blocks editor is an environment that involves where the app inventors can visibly lay out the logic of their apps through the use of color-coded blocks that would join together, just like puzzle pieces in order to demonstrate the program. Lastly, in order to assist the development and testing, MIT provides a mobile app called the App Inventor Companion, in which the developers can use to adjust and test in order to monitor the behaviour of their apps. Hence, anyone can build a mobile app and immediately start to test and recapitulate quickly.</p> 

<h3>Tools and Technologies - The software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.</h3>
  
<p>The software that are a part of this game and MIT app inventor includes inspirations from languages such as Scratch and StarLogo TNG, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. Also, other software components include GNU/Linux (Debian 5 or higher and Ubuntu 8 or higher), Windows (Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP), and Macintosh with an Intel Processor (Mac OS X 10.5 or more higher), which are all computer operating systems. Lastly, browser requirements include Mozila Firefox 3.6 or higher (if you’re using it with the NoScript extension, the extension must be turned off), Apple Safari 5.0 or higher, Google Chrome 4.0 or higher, which are mandatory for the app inventor to run successfully. However, Microsoft Internet Explorer isn’t recommended and reinforced.</p>  
    
<h3>Skills Required - The skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h3>
  
<p>The skills that are required for this project includes the basics of making your projects from MIT project app that include the use of the “designer” editor component that determines the search of your components of your choice and to select certain properties of each component such as size, colour and behaviour. Lastly, the use of the “blocks” editor component for this project is used for the preferred behaviours for particular components. You can do this by looking for Blocks for the general behaviours you want to apply to your project by dragging them to the Blocks Viewer. Lastly, the skills, software and the hardware required are achievable through YouTube tutorials for tips and steps on how to create your first project or game, even if you’re just learning. Also, searching for the particular language, software and hardware used are achievable to find through the actual MIT app inventor website which will tell you the details regarding about the specific software and even versions and browsers that are applicable to use this inventor app for your projects.</p>

<p>PSA: The screenshots were taken during the process of the game, not the final results.</p>

<h3>Outcome - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h3>

<p>If this project was successful, the outcome will be a good starting point due to the usefulness of this app that will lead to enticing new users playing this game. With a combination of low levels of difficulty in terms of how to play the game and the skills needed and the simplicity of the game in terms of visuals, effects, and movements will lead this game to further success. Fixing minor problems in the software and adjusting the sizes and behaviour of each component if changes are being implemented can lead to upgrading your project slowly via designer and blocks editor sections. Lastly, the impact of this development will be a good comparison with other simple apps that are just getting started from small markets and hopefully it can grow one day due to how easy the game is being played and the way it draws you in after a long exhausting day.</p>
